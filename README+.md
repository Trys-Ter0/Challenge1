# Horiseon: HTML CSS Code Refactor

## Project Description
Horiseon tasked me with refactoring the CSS and improving accessibility of their website. This meant auditing and optimising the HTML for semantic tags, and consolidating selectors and properties in CSS. I also reordered the CSS to follow the semantic structure of the HTML. Changes are commented in the code.
